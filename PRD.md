# BookVault Gmail Authentication - Product Requirements Document

BookVault is a digital reading companion that helps users track their reading progress, manage their book library, and set reading goals with seamless Gmail authentication integration.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Effortless** - Authentication should be as simple as a single click with Gmail integration
2. **Trustworthy** - Users feel secure knowing their data is protected with Google's OAuth system  
3. **Unified** - Consistent experience whether users choose Gmail or email/password authentication

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
Gmail authentication adds convenience while maintaining the core reading tracking functionality without overwhelming complexity.

## Essential Features

### Gmail OAuth Integration
- **Functionality**: One-click sign in/up using Google accounts with automatic profile import
- **Purpose**: Reduces friction and eliminates password management for users
- **Trigger**: User clicks "Continue with Google" button on login or register screens
- **Progression**: Button click → Google account selection modal → Automatic account creation/login → Dashboard access
- **Success criteria**: Users can authenticate in under 10 seconds with their existing Google accounts

### Fallback Email Authentication  
- **Functionality**: Traditional email/password registration and login for users preferring direct accounts
- **Purpose**: Provides alternative for users who prefer not to use Google OAuth
- **Trigger**: User chooses email option after Gmail option
- **Progression**: Toggle email form → Fill credentials → Validation → Account creation/login
- **Success criteria**: Both authentication methods work seamlessly with identical post-auth experience

### Unified User Profile Management
- **Functionality**: Consistent user experience regardless of authentication method with avatar support
- **Purpose**: Ensures feature parity between Gmail and email users
- **Trigger**: User accesses profile or user menu
- **Progression**: Profile access → Display user info with appropriate avatar → Settings management
- **Success criteria**: Gmail users see their Google profile picture, all users have access to same features

## Edge Case Handling

- **Cancelled Google Sign-in**: Graceful error message without breaking flow
- **Existing Email Conflict**: Clear messaging when Gmail email matches existing email account  
- **Network Failures**: Retry mechanisms and offline-friendly error states
- **Demo Account Simulation**: Mock Google accounts for demonstration purposes

## Design Direction

The design should feel modern and trustworthy, evoking the reliability of established platforms like Google while maintaining BookVault's warm, literary aesthetic. Clean and minimal interface better serves the core reading focus without distracting from content.

## Color Selection

Analogous color scheme using warm, book-inspired tones that complement Google's blue accents.

- **Primary Color**: Warm brown (`oklch(0.45 0.08 45)`) - Evokes leather-bound books and academic libraries
- **Secondary Colors**: Cream backgrounds (`oklch(0.92 0.02 75)`) for comfortable reading surfaces  
- **Accent Color**: Soft teal (`oklch(0.65 0.15 65)`) - Highlights important actions and Google integration elements
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Cream #F5F3F0): Dark brown text (#3D2914) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Primary (Warm Brown #6B4423): Cream text (#F5F3F0) - Ratio 6.1:1 ✓  
  - Accent (Soft Teal #5A9B8E): White text (#FFFFFF) - Ratio 4.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Inter font family conveys modern professionalism while maintaining excellent readability across all interface elements and authentication flows.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (Page Titles): Inter Bold/24px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Card Titles): Inter Semibold/20px/normal spacing  
  - Body (Form Labels): Inter Medium/14px/normal spacing
  - Small (Helper Text): Inter Regular/12px/relaxed spacing

## Animations

Subtle and functional animations that build trust during the authentication process without feeling playful or distracting from the serious nature of account security.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Loading states communicate progress, transitions maintain context during auth flows
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Google sign-in button deserves focus animation, form validation feedback uses micro-animations

## Component Selection

- **Components**: Card for auth forms, Button variants for different auth methods, Dialog for Google account selection, Avatar with image support, DropdownMenu for user profiles
- **Customizations**: Google-styled button with proper branding, loading states for OAuth flow
- **States**: Buttons show loading, disabled, and success states; forms handle validation errors gracefully
- **Icon Selection**: GoogleLogo for OAuth buttons, User/SignOut for profile management
- **Spacing**: Consistent 1rem padding with 0.5rem gaps using Tailwind's spacing scale
- **Mobile**: Auth forms stack vertically, Google button maintains touch-friendly 44px height, responsive card layouts
